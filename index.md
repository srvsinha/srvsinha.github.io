## Projects

### 1. Neural Network‑based Approximation of Nonlinear Systems in Koopman Form

Description: This work utilizes the Koopman operator theory to approximate nonlinear dynamical systems with bilinear and linear parameter‑varying systems. We develop a recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture using PyTorch to learn the systems and characterize uncertain initial conditions. Neural network weights are parameterized a priori to ensure stable and norm‑bounded system behavior. Robust controllers for nonlinear systems are designed based on learned models.

### 2. Robust Control Design for Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs)

Description: This work provides an integral quadratic constraint-based analysis framework developed for synthesizing and analyzing robust, path-following controllers for AUVs. We apply deep learning techniques with PyTorch to model the hydrodynamics of an AUV using a feedforward neural network. Controllers are tuned using an automated tuning routine that quickly refines an initial controller, yielding one with significantly enhanced robust performance. The controllers are implemented on the AUV platform using C++, and comprehensive underwater experiments are conducted in Claytor Lake, Virginia, USA, to validate the controllers.
